The data collection code is found by running the file 'data_logging_script_microbit.py' and pressing the A button to start data collection then pressing the A button once again to end the data collection.

For simulation code run 'simulation_code.py' this will produce three graphs one with velocity vs. time
another with position vs. time and a final of acceleration vs. time

The parsing code is run with 'csvreader.py' to parse a file and clean it put the path of the file in and run the code to get 
cleaned data

To calculate the period and find the relationships between period & lengths run the file 'csvreader.py' this will automatically run with the csv file that was used for parsing
